    During the Newton cycle support for baremetal
    provisioning with bifrost was added to kolla.
    Bifrost is a collection of ansible roles and
    playbooks to deploy a standalone instance of
    ironic.
features:
  - A new deploy-bifrost command was added to
    kolla-ansible. The deploy-bifrost command
    will deploy and bootstrap a standalone
    instance of ironic in a single container.
  - A new deploy-server command was added to
    kolla-ansible. The deploy-server command
    uses a locally deployed instance of bifrost
    to enrole servers with ironic and provision
    their os.
