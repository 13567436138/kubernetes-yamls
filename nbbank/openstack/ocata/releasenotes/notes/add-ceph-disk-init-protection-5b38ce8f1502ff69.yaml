    There any multiple options available to an operator
    with regards to how they wish to provision devices
    for use with Ceph OSDs. One of those is to co-locate
    the data and journal on a disk, which is done by
    marking a partition on that disk with
    `KOLLA_CEPH_OSD[_CACHE]_BOOTSTRAP`.
    If an unwitting user happened to confuse this with
    the partition based approach, they could wipe out
    their entire disk, resulting in data loss.
features:
  - The Ceph bootstrap will now pause requesting
    confirmation from the operator if it detects a
    bootstrap label on a disk with more than one
    partition.
    An operator may override this behaviour by
    setting the Ansible variable
    'ceph_osd_wipe_disk' to
    'yes-i-really-really-mean-it'.
