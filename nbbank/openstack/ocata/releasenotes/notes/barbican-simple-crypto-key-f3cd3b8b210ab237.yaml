    Fixes an issue with the barbican service when using the ``simple_crypto``
    plugin whereby an invalid value is generated and used as the plugin's
    encryption key.

    The encryption key is configured via the ``[simple_crypto_plugin]: kek``
    configuration option in ``barbican.conf``.  This option was previously
    configured using the kolla-ansible variable ``barbican_crypto_password``,
    but is now configured using ``barbican_crypto_key`` which uses the correct
    format.

    Operators that have set ``barbican_crypto_password`` to a valid value
    to work around this issue should ensure that ``barbican_crypto_key``
    is configured in ``passwords.yml`` with the same value that was used for
    ``barbican_crypto_password``. This will ensure that existing barbican
    secrets can be decrypted.

    The variable ``barbican_crypto_password`` may safely be removed from
    ``passwords.yml``.
