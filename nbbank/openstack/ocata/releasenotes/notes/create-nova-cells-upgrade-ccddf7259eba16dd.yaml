upgrade:

    Nova cells are required as of Ocata release, before upgrade database should
    be created. Due a bug in Nova, only latest code can be used to create
    default cells. Ensure nova is fully updated and have this patch applied
    before start upgrade to Ocata https://review.openstack.org/#/c/420051/ or
    upgrade to Kolla 3.0.3 first.
